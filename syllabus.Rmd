#### What you will learn
This is a modern class in phylogenetic methods. You will learn how to get data, build a tree, use comparative methods, and how to make new methods. More importantly, you will learn _why_ to do all this.

#### Requirements
* A laptop on which you can install software (have root / admin access)
    + It'll be easiest if this is a Mac; less easy is Linux; Windows will be hard
* A question and some data to answer it
* GitHub account
* Slack
* R
* And other software we'll learn about during the course

I am writing a textbook as part of the course
* [HTML version](https://bookdown.org/bomeara/comparative-methods/)
* [PDF](https://bookdown.org/bomeara/comparative-methods/comparative-methods.pdf)

It will be updated as we go, so check back frequently.

#### Evaluation
Grading will be based on effort and performance. Some of the things will be harder for some students than others just given differences in what they've been exposed to so far, and I don't want to penalize students who are less skilled at R, for example. But I do require that you put in work on this class: work through the exercises, think about the papers, etc. Much of the homework is chewy, so it will take some thought to get through, and you might not be able to do all of this. That's ok.

* EEB603 final project will be done solo (though consulting is ok)
* EEB504 final project will be done in pairs

#### Teaching
The class is generally flipped: rather than me droning at the front of the room, I'll be releasing videos online for you to watch. They will be linked to from this syllabus. In class, talk about what was not clear from the videos about methods, and we'll dig into that. We can also work on problematic parts of the exercises (you should do most of them before class) and talk about papers.

#### Online option
There is a no-credit online option, as well.
